Create a 30-day social media content calendar for ${brandName}, targeting the audience described in ${brandBrief}, and highlighting ${productsInFocus}.

The calendar must:
• Respect the brand’s tone, visual identity, and audience preferences as described in ${brandBrief} and ${website}.
• Clearly organize output in a table with these columns:
  - Date
  - Platform
  - Content Format (Reel, Static Post, Carousel, Story, Pin, etc.)
  - Caption
  - Hashtags
  - Design Brief / Visual Concept (clear, actionable directions)
  - Newsletter (Y/N; no more than 3)
  - Pinterest Reference (descriptive visual prompt, no URLs)
• Limit newsletters to max 3 posts.
• Label any repurposed content clearly.
• Stories are not counted as posts but can be suggested to complement posts.
• Do not assume platforms or events beyond those explicitly stated in ${brandBrief}, ${website}, or ${events}.
• Use [Creative Suggestion] or [Inference] if proposing ideas not explicitly in the inputs.
• Recommend optimal posting days and times where possible.
• Follow the content type distribution:
  - Product: ${contentDistribution.productPercentage}%
  - Engagement: ${contentDistribution.engagementPercentage}%
  - Sale: ${contentDistribution.salePercentage}%
• Start the calendar on ${startingDate} at a pace of ${postsPerWeek} posts per week, covering ${noOfPosts} posts in total.
