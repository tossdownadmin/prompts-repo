‚öôÔ∏è Execution Rules
‚úÖ Pinterest / Visual Reference:
In the Pinterest Reference column, provide descriptive visual reference prompts, not URLs. These should clearly describe the intended look, mood, or theme ‚Äî so designers can use them as search queries or creative direction.
Example: ‚ÄúSearch: vibrant burger flatlay, red-black-white color scheme, rustic table‚Äù

‚úÖ Content Repurposing:
Clearly label at least one post per week as a repurposed content piece, noting the source content (e.g., Reel ‚Üí Carousel Recap).

‚úÖ Optimal Posting Times:
Recommend optimal posting days and times for each post if not already defined in the brand brief.

‚úÖ Posts vs. Stories:
Stories are not counted as posts. The ${noOfPosts} total refers only to posts (e.g., Reels, Static Posts, Carousels, Articles, etc.) and explicitly excludes Stories.
Stories may still be suggested as part of the plan, and they may also be used to repurpose or amplify posts ‚Äî but they do not count toward the total post number.

‚úÖ Newsletter Limit:
Mark no more than 3 posts maximum as Y in the Newsletter column ‚Äî regardless of the total calendar length. Prioritize educational, promotional, or high-engagement posts for newsletters.

‚úÖ Platform Limitation:
Only include platforms explicitly mentioned in the ${brandBrief} or clearly visible on the ${website}. Do not assume or suggest additional platforms beyond those specified.

‚úÖ Cultural Sensitivity:
Include only events explicitly provided in ${events} or the brand brief. If no specific events are given, default to universal or seasonal content (e.g., weekends, general holidays).
